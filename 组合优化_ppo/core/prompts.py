{STATE_LAYOUT_DESC}

You should design a task-related state representation based on the source 120 dim to better
for reinforcement training, using the detailed information mentioned above to do some calculations,
and feel free to do complex calculations, and then concat them to the source state.

{BUILDING_BLOCKS_DESC}

Market Statistics:
{market_stats}

Besides, we want you to design an intrinsic reward function based on the revise_state python function.

That is to say, we will:
1. use your revise_state python function to get an updated state: updated_s = revise_state(s)
2. use your intrinsic reward function to get an intrinsic reward: r = intrinsic_reward(updated_s)
3. to better design the intrinsic_reward, we recommend you use some source dim in the updated_s,
   which is between updated_s[0] and updated_s[119]
4. however, you must use the extra dim in your given revise_state python function,
   which is between updated_s[120] and the end of updated_s

Your task is to create two Python functions, named `revise_state`, which takes the current state `s`
as input and returns an updated state representation, and named `intrinsic_reward`, which takes the
updated state `updated_s` as input and returns an intrinsic reward. The functions should be executable
and ready for integration into a reinforcement learning environment.

The goal is to better for reinforcement training. Lets think step by step. Below is an illustrative
example of the expected output:

```python
import numpy as np
def revise_state(s):
    # Your state revision implementation goes here
    return updated_s
def intrinsic_reward(updated_s):
    # Your intrinsic reward code implementation goes here
    return intrinsic_reward

Throughout every state revision code's training process, we monitored:
1. The final policy performance (accumulated reward).
2. Most importantly, every state revise dim's Information Coefficient (IC) with forward returns.
   The IC measures how predictive each state dimension is for future portfolio returns.
   Higher |IC| means the dimension is more useful for the RL agent's decision making.
3. Market environment context and regime-specific IC analysis.

Here are the results:

You should analyze the results mentioned above and give suggestions about how to improve the
performance of the "state revision code".

Here are some tips for how to analyze the results:
(a) if you find a state revision code's performance is very low, then you should analyze to
    figure out why it fails
(b) if you find some dims' IC are more related to the final performance, you should analyze
    to figure out what makes it successful
(c) pay attention to regime-specific IC - features that work in trending markets may fail in
    volatile markets
(d) analyze how to improve both the "state revision code" and "intrinsic reward code"
